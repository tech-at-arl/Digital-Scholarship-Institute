# Code of Conduct
The ARL Digital Scholarship Institute is committed to creating and supporting an inclusive community of practice. We are dedicated to providing an experience free from all forms of harassment, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion. 
 
In order to cultivate a welcoming learning environment, we suggest: making sure you’re  listening as much as you speak; encouraging participation from those who may have different viewpoints; using inclusive language by honoring pronoun preferences and favoring gender-neutral collective nouns (“people,” not “guys”); offering—and accepting—constructive criticism; giving credit where it is due; and staying alert to the welfare of those around you.
 
Harassment impedes everyone’s ability to participate in our community. Harassment includes, but is not limited to unwelcome or offensive verbal comments or nonverbal expressions related to age; appearance or body size; employment or military status; ethnicity; gender identity or expression; individual lifestyles; marital status; national origin; physical or cognitive ability; political affiliation; sexual orientation; race; or religion. 
 
Harassment can also include use of sexual and/or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online); deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; bullying behavior; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.
 
Sexual and/or discriminatory images and language are not appropriate for Digital Scholarship Institute venues, including talks, workshops, receptions, and online media. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender and expulsion from the event.
 
## What to Do
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the ARL staff immediately.
