# Exercise 3: Create item, collection, exhibit in Omeka

## Self-guided exercises

Now that you've described and arranged items in an analog format in Exercise 2, let's perform those same activities in Omeka's digital environment. Sign into your [Omeka.net](http://www.omeka.net) account and work through these self-guided exercises:

1. Transfer item descriptions from cards to [shared metadata spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UPg8tbS3cpTgDvEJ6lGOPQawPZnXMW0YEYgtJYfY850/edit?usp=sharing) in Google Drive.
2. [Add a New Item](https://jaguillette.github.io/omekaSugar/tutorial/items/2016/09/02/add-an-item.html).
3. [Add a New Collection](https://jaguillette.github.io/omekaSugar/tutorial/collections/2016/09/06/add-a-collection.html).
4. [Make an Exhibit](https://jaguillette.github.io/omekaSugar/tutorial/collections/2016/09/06/make-an-exhibit.html).

As you work independently, let us know how you're doing by flagging your laptop using the sticky notes provided:

- :cool: **Green**. It's going great!
- :question: **Pink**. We're stumped.
- :100: **Blue**. I'm finished!

If you get stuck, first ask a fellow workshop participant how they worked through the roadblock you're encountering. Still stumped? Flag your laptop with the pink sticky. Help is on its way!

## Batch upload demo

It's great to know how to add items and files individually using Omeka's web interface. As the number of items increases, there's a tipping point at which you may want to perform a batch upload of items and files. The workshop facilitators will demo a batch upload using our collaboratively created metadata spreadsheet.

## Credit Where Credit Is Due

Self-guided activities are drawn from [Omeka Sugar: Tutorials for Digital Exhibits](https://jaguillette.github.io/omekaSugar) created by [Jeremy Guillette](https://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/jeremy-guillette), Digital Scholarship Facilitator for the History Department at Harvard University.

The sticky note strategy we learned about from Miriam Posner (see [A better way to teach technical skills to a group](http://miriamposner.com/blog/a-better-way-to-teach-technical-skills-to-a-group)), who in turn borrowed it from [Deb Verhoeven](https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/people/deb-verhoeven).
