## Workshop Schedule


## Learning Goals
The learning goals set forth by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) Digital Scholarship Institute are meant to uphold the overarching goal of the ARL Academy, which has been created to “foster the development of an agile, diverse and highly-motivated workforce as well as the inspiring leadership necessary to meet present and future challenges.”

By the end of the institute, participants will:

* describe how digital scholarship fits into higher education and why academic libraries are engaging in digital scholarship
* demonstrate confidence in their ability to engage with digital scholarship projects by developing strategies for advancing their roles as contributors, as partners and/or co-creators in digital scholarship projects
* identify the hallmarks of digital scholarship/critical elements and methodological principles that qualifies scholarly work as digital scholarship
* evaluate different digital scholarship methodologies and tools
* integrate existing skillsets into those needed for digital scholarship
* envision digital scholarship as a collaborative endeavor by identifying individual researchers or local institutional units with whom they feel confident working to continue furthering their knowledge and practice of digital scholarship
* establish an integrated cohort as part of this institute to cultivate ongoing  knowledge-sharing, skill-building, and networking during and beyond the institute

## Code of Conduct

## History of the Institute
From 2017-2019, the ARL Digital Scholarship Institute (DSI) was a five-day, cohort-based opportunity for professionals in ARL member libraries who are new to digital scholarship to develop their skills in an intensive, yet supportive, learner-centered environment. Guided by the principles of community, diversity, impact, openness, and sustainability, the Digital Scholarship Institute foregrounds critical thinking about the content and context of the modern research ecosystem. Participants were trained in a core set of methodologies and tools that will provide both a knowledge base and the confidence to work through the cultural changes sweeping through academic libraries and higher education today. 

The first ARL Digital Scholarship Institute was hosted by Boston College Libraries at the Connors Center in Dover, Massachusetts in 2017. Co-sponsors included the University Library, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Indiana University Libraries; River Campus Libraries, the University of Rochester; and UC San Diego Libraries. Subsequent DSIs were hosted by UC San Diego Libraries (2018), Indiana University Libraries (2018), and River Campus Libraries, the University of Rochester (2019).
