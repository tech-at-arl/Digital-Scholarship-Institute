# Care as a Compass: Grounding DS in Community
### Instructors: Cristela Garcia-Spitz, Frederick Carey, and Pamela Espinosa de los Monteros

This workshop will explore how digital scholars can center the community and approach each phase of the research process with care by critically examining the provenance, portrayal, and management of data. We define care as advocating for all individuals and communities either impacted by or explicitly represented in the research process; recognizing and mitigating privilege, bias, and potential harm inherent within research tools and methodologies; and confronting any silences or gaps present in research materials. Together we will discuss championing community-centered project goals, navigating tools and institutional constraints, critically engaging data gaps and silences, new and/or alternative methodologies and practices, and participating in crucial conversations with project stakeholders. To help guide our conversation, we will visit existing digital projects in order to apply care concepts to practical situations. Participants will be encouraged to reflect on the intersections of care with their own approaches to digital scholarship.
