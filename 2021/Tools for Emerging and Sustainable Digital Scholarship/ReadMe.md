# Tools for Emerging and Sustainable Digital Scholarship
### Instructors: Zach Coble and Nickoal Eichmann-Kalwara

### Description
In recent years, digital scholarship has moved towards sustainable and lateral infrastructure with minimal computing technologies. This session will address 1) web-based computational environments for learning to program and publishing code, and 2) static website frameworks for building digital collections and exhibits. Participants will come away with familiarity of various tools and methods, exemplary projects, and potential workflows and ideas for their own projects.

### Learning Outcomes
1. Become familiar with minimal computing approaches and techniques in digital scholarship and how they are used 
2. Feel comfortable evaluating these emerging tools for use at their home institution, across disciplines and contexts
