# Tools for Emerging and Sustainable Digital Scholarship
### Instructors: Zach Coble and Nickoal Eichmann-Kalwara

In recent years, digital scholarship has moved towards sustainable and lateral infrastructure with minimal computing technologies. This session will address 1) web-based computational environments for learning to program and publishing code, and 2) static website frameworks for building digital collections and exhibits. Participants will come away with familiarity of various tools and methods, exemplary projects, and potential workflows and ideas for their own projects.
