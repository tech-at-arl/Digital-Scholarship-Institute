# Getting Started with Text Preparation and Analysis: A Hands-on Overview of Tools and Approaches
### Instructors: Alexandra Provo and Jay Brodeur

Are you interested in textual analysis but unsure about where to start? Join us for an interactive “no experience required” introduction to the fundamental concepts, processes, and methodological approaches for preparing and analyzing text. Following a general introduction to the topic, participants will be guided through prepared exercises that demonstrate how different software packages (OpenRefine, Python) can be used to prepare for and perform textual analysis. Those with no previous Python programming experience will be provided an opportunity to learn the basics through self-guided modules before the session (optional). Most importantly, participants will leave the session with more confidence using a variety of software and computational approaches, and a better understanding of where to find additional learning resources to further their training.
