# Exercise 2: Describe items and arrange into themes

## Instructions

1. Workshop facilitators will pass out sample items printed on handouts.

2. Working individually, describe 1–2 items by filling out metadata fields (e.g. title, subject) printed on the handout. Reference the [spreadsheet of sample collection items](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UPg8tbS3cpTgDvEJ6lGOPQawPZnXMW0YEYgtJYfY850/edit?usp=sharing) in order to locate a clickable URL for each image, from which you can glean clues for the description of your item.

3. Working in small groups of ~5, arrange cards into possible thematic groups.

4. A representative of each small group will share design decisions made while describing and arranging, as well as any outstanding questions, with all workshop participants.

## What do these metadata fields mean?!

Out of the box, Omeka uses Dublin Core elements as metadata fields, one of the sets of [Dublin Core terms](http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms). We have provided some guidance on what these fields mean below. For a deeper dive, consult [Working with Dublin Core in Omeka](https://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core) and [Using the Dublin Core Elements](http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements.shtml).

| Metadata Field | Definition | Notes on Usage |
| -------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| dc.title | Name of the item you are describing. | Establish conventions, e.g. sentence case vs. title case, supplied information in brackets, etc. |
| dc.creator | The person or organization primarily responsible for making the item you are describing, e.g., artist, author. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as the [Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html), [Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html), or the [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)](https://viaf.org). |
| dc.contributor | Person or organization responsible for making contributions to the resource, e.g. illustrator. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as the [Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html), [Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html), or the [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)](https://viaf.org). |
| dc.date | Point or period of time associated with the item, e.g. date original item was created. | Use the [international standard for date and time formats](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html), e.g. 2017-01-01, which is nicely summarized in this [W3C note on date and time formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). |
| dc.description | A free-text account of the item you are describing. | A good place for information that doesn't fit in other, more structured metadata fields. |
| dc.rights | Information about the rights status of the item. | Use standard descriptions such as [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses) or the statements from [RightsStatements.org](http://rightsstatements.org/en). |
| dc.subject | Topic of the item you are describing. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as the [Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) or [Thesaurus for Graphic Materials (TGM)](http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials.html). |
| dc.coverage | The spatial or temporal topic of the item being described: instead of the place or date when the item was created, the place or date that an item is about, e.g. the event that a monument commemorates. | For spatial topics, use a controlled vocabulary such as the [Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn). For temporal topics, use a structured format similar to that for dc.date. |
| dc.publisher | Person or organization responsible for making the item available. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as the [Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html), [Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html), or the [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)](https://viaf.org). |
| dc.relation | Citation of a related item. | Include URL to item, e.g., if it appears in another digital collection. |
| dc.source | Citation to where this item was found, e.g. collecting institution or or print resource. | Include URL to item, e.g., if it appears in another digital collection. |
| dc.format | Physical medium, file format, or dimensions of the item. | Use a controlled vocabulary, such as the [Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat). |
| dc.type | Nature or genre of the item. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as the [DCMI Type Vocabulary](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#H7). |
| dc.language | A language of the item. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as [RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.txt). According to this specification English as used in the United States would en-US. Otherwise, just be consistent! |
| dc.identifier | An unambiguous reference to the item. | E.g. file name or URI. |
