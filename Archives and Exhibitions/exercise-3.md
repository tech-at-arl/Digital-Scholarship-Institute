# Exercise 3: Create item, collection, exhibit in Omeka

Now that you've described and arranged items in an analog format in Exercise 2, let's perform those same activities in Omeka's digital environment. Sign into your [Omeka.net](http://www.omeka.net) account and work through these self-guided activities:

1. [Add a New Item](https://jaguillette.github.io/omekaSugar/tutorial/items/2016/09/02/add-an-item.html)
2. [Add a New Collection](https://jaguillette.github.io/omekaSugar/tutorial/collections/2016/09/06/add-a-collection.html)
3. [Make an Exhibit](https://jaguillette.github.io/omekaSugar/tutorial/collections/2016/09/06/make-an-exhibit.html)

As you work independently, let us know how you're doing by flagging your laptop using the sticky notes provided:

- :cool: **Green**. It's going great!
- :question: **Pink**. We're stumped.
- :100: **Blue**. I'm finished!

If you get stuck, first ask a fellow workshop participant how they worked through the roadblock you're encountering. If you're still stumped, flag your laptop with the pink sticky. Help is on its way!
